# Check Results

When you execute a test scenario containing checks, the result will be either pass or fail. In the case of a failure, you may want to investigate the reasons why.&#x20;

Execute a test scenario, or navigate to a historical run, and select the **Checks** tab.

Click into a failed check to see the **actual result** against the **expected result**.&#x20;

:::info
**Tip!** Revisit a historical test run via the **Executions** module within the **Insights** tab.
:::

In the below example, the [Test Check](.) has **failed** because the expected value does not match the actual value.&#x20;

_Any test checks that fail will cause the Test Scenario to be considered a fail._

In the below example, the Test Check has **succeeded.**

_Therefore, the test scenario is considered a **pass**._

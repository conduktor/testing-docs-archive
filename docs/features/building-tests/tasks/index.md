# Tasks

Tasks are the building blocks that make up a [Test Scenario](/platform/testing/features/building-tests/test-scenarios). Each task represents an action, for example:

- Producing to Kafka
- Consuming from Kafka

It's possible to create a scenario consisting of a single task, or many tasks that are chained together using the [Task Ports](/platform/testing/features/building-tests/tasks/task-ports).

In the diagram below, the scenario has **2 tasks** configured**.**&#x20;

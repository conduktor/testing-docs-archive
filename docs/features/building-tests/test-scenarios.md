# Test Scenarios

Test Scenarios represent a set of tasks used to validate some functionality in your application, pipeline, or service.

Test scenarios can be specified in two ways:

- Using the visual editor
- Using the [DSL](../dsl) (Domain-specific language)

If you choose to use the visual editor, you can later **export** the DSL. Equally, if you specify your scenario using the DSL, you can later **import** it to see a visual representation of your test.

## Create a Test Scenario

From within a [Test Suite](test-suites), select **New Scenario** to add a new scenario. You will be prompted to provide a name to identify your test scenario.&#x20;

Once your scenario is created, you will be pushed into the **Editor** view. This is where you can create your set of [Tasks](tasks).

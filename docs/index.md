## Overview

Conduktor Testing supports automated testing of applications and pipelines that integrate streaming data. 

Use our Testing solution to test your **event-driven applications**, **Kafka streams applications** or any other **event-streaming architecture**.

Conduktor Testing provides:
 - An **interactive canvas** for constructing your test scenarios
 - A mechanism for integrating continuous Kafka testing with **all CI/CD** tools 
 - **Advanced checks** to assert the data flowing through your Kafka systems 
 - Methods for chaining together Kafka actions with **HTTP tasks (REST APIs)** and **loading external files**

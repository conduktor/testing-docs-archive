# Connect to a Kafka Cluster

You must add a Kafka cluster in your [Workspace](/features/workspace). This enables you to reference the cluster when building [Test Scenarios](/features/building-tests/test-scenarios).

The ability to reach your cluster will depend on where you have setup the [Testing Agent](install-the-testing-agent).

:::info
If you started Conduktor via **Docker**, you should have already configured your Kafka Clusters and can skip this.
:::

## Adding a cluster

To add a Kafka cluster, navigate to the **Clusters** tab from within your [Workspace](/features/workspace).

![](<../assets/image (14).png>)

Select **Create New** and you will be presented with the cluster configuration modal.

![](<../assets/image (173).png>)

You will be required to input the following information:

- **Cluster name:** This will enable you to reference your cluster when using it in test scenarios.
- **Bootstrap servers:** The list of host and port pairs used to establish the initial connection to the Kafka cluster
- **Additional properties:** Additional properties that you would usually provide your CLI or Java clients. This is especially important if you have a **secure Kafka cluster**.

Note it's possible to paste the list of additional properties by toggling **Switch view.**

![](<../assets/image (102).png>)

When you have configured the cluster properties, click **refresh** to check the **connection status**.

## Schema Registry

When you configure a cluster, you also have the option to configure Schema Registry. Conduktor supports the Avro, JSON and Protobuf formats.

Select the **Schema registry** tab from within the cluster configuration modal to get started.

![](<../assets/image (43).png>)

- **Schema Registry URL:** HTTP or HTTPS endpoint of your schema registry
- **Authentication**: Select your authentication method (None, Basic or Bearer token)
- **Additional Properties**: Any additional properties required for your connection. For example, properties that define your SSL truststore/keystore location and password.

## Connect to a Local Kafka cluster

You are able to connect to a Kafka cluster that is running on your localhost. For example, a cluster that has been started via [Docker](https://github.com/conduktor/kafka-stack-docker-compose), or via the Kafka binaries.

**The only pre-requisite** is that the [Testing Agent](install-the-testing-agent) is running on a host that has access to your cluster.

:::tip
**Pro tip!** You can [start a Kafka cluster in seconds](https://docs.conduktor.io/kafka-cluster-connection/starting-a-local-kafka-cluster-in-seconds) using our other product, Conduktor Desktop
:::

To connect to Kafka running on localhost:

- Ensure your agent is running, and selected via the dropdown in the navigation
- Provide the host and port like any other cluster, for example: **localhost:9092**

## Connect to a secure Kafka cluster

Conduktor leverages the default Apache Kafka Java Clients, and therefore we use the same [configuration properties](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs).

When the Conduktor Testing application needs to connect to a secure Kafka cluster, you must specify the values from your `config.properties` file.

For example:

```
ssl.truststore.location=/path/to/client.truststore-6597145213355562865.jks
ssl.truststore.password=test5494c04
security.protocol=SSL
ssl.keystore.type=PKCS12
ssl.keystore.location=/path/to/client.keystore-12124676830593951314.p12
ssl.keystore.password=test632ecc3
ssl.key.password=test632ecc3
```

For more detail, visit the [docs](https://docs.conduktor.io/kafka-cluster-connection/setting-up-a-connection-to-kafka/connecting-to-a-secure-kafka) for our Conduktor Desktop product.

## Connect to a Confluent cluster

Via your Confluent cluster dashboard, select the **Clients** tab within **Data integration.**

Select **Java** as the language.

![](<../assets/image (136).png>)

Create the **Kafka cluster** **API key.** You also have the option to create the **Schema Registry API Key** if you are using Schema Registry.

![](<../assets/image (143).png>)

**Copy** the configuration to your clipboard.

From within the cluster configuration modal of the Testing application, **Paste** your configuration as additional properties.

:::caution
**Note:** You will need to **remove any comments from the configuration**, and **move the bootstrap server URL** to the correct form input. If you are not using the schema registry, you can also remove these properties.
:::

**Refresh** the connection and if successful, you will see the **CONNECTED** label turn green.

![](<../assets/image (24).png>)

Click **Create Cluster** to save your cluster.

## Connect to a Aiven cluster

To connect to an Aiven cluster, you must specify the **Access Key**, **Access Certificate**, and **CA Certificate**.

To obtain these files, go to: [https://console.aiven.io/project/](https://console.aiven.io/project)\<project\>/services/\<cluster\>


From within the cluster configuration modal, add the Bootstrap server. This is labelled **Service URI** within the Aiven console.

Using the **additional properties,** reference the **absolute path** of the files downloaded from the Aiven console.

For example:

```
ssl.keystore.location = /path/to/client.keystore.p12
```

It's important that the [Testing Agent](install-the-testing-agent) is running on a host with access to these files.

![](<../assets/image (138).png>)

:::tip
**Pro Tip!** If you are using the Conduktor Desktop GUI, you can use the **Aiven wizard** to setup your cluster configuration and paste the config into Testing.
:::

## Connect to a Red Hat cluster

Select **Connection** from your Red Hat Kafka Instance

![](<../assets/image (11) (1) (1).png>)

From within the slide-out menu, choose **Create service account**

![](<../assets/image (12).png>)

Copy the credentials that are generated in the subsequent modal.

![](<../assets/image (126).png>)

Create a cluster inside Conduktor Testing using the below additional properties.

Note you must replace the **clientId** and **clientSecret** with the service account credentials that were generated in the previous step.

```
sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url=https://identity.api.openshift.com/auth/realms/rhoas/protocol/openid-connect/token
sasl.login.callback.handler.class=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.secured.OAuthBearerLoginCallbackHandler
sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.oauthbearer.OAuthBearerLoginModule required clientId="YOUR-CLIENT-ID" clientSecret="YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET" ssl.protocol="SSL" ;
sasl.mechanism=OAUTHBEARER
security.protocol=SASL_SSL
```

## Connect to a MSK cluster

For connecting to MSK, we recommend installing the [Testing Agent](install-the-testing-agent) on an EC2 instance with access to the cluster.

:::info
Note that you will need to configure **Security Groups** so that the cluster's security group can accept traffic coming from the EC2 instance's security group. See [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/create-client-machine.html).
:::

When you create an Agent inside the Testing UI, you will be provided the commands for downloading and running it.

Execute these commands on your EC2 instance, and you should see the message:

`Agent <agent name> connected!`

![](../assets/image.png)

From within the Testing UI, you should now be able to see that the Agent is connected:

![](<../assets/image (8) (3).png>)

Navigate to the Clusters tab, and **Create** a new cluster.

- Add the bootstrap servers
  - For MSK, you can find this by selecting the Cluster within AWS > MSK and clicking **View client information**
- Add any required configuration properties
